This directory contains the files for the multio design.
The multio PCB has a maximum of 128 I/O ports which can be
access over an I2C interface. A working prototype has been built.
Example Python programs for the Raspberry-Pi are available too.

This design has been on Github for free for a long time but under 
my personal account. Nobody was interested or they did not know it
existed. In case it was the latter, I moved it alongside the VGA666
adapater.

The PCB design is such that sections of 16 I/O ports can be 
removed from the PCB thus giving 16, 32, 64 etc. I/O ports.

Important Note: Building one at a time of these boards will
be expensive. It is recomended to build in batches to reduce
costs.

All files are released under the GPLv3 licence.
If you built a batch or take it up into your product 
portfolio it would be nice to hear from you.
